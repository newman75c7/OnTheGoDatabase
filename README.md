# OnTheGo Database

OnTheGo Database is a small embedded database engine. It supports basic database operations  such as DDL(create, drop database/table) and DML(select, insert, update, delete). Aside from which, it also provides the JDBC driver that can deal with OnTheGo Database for Java Software. 
 The reason why I started to write the OnTheGo Database is that I have thought a database is a good example to study compilers and data structures as well as I have been eager to make something to be useful for people as outstanding programmers did. Moreover, I earned profound understand about database internals. Since the project was started, I have written 8,845 lines of java codes to it for about two weeks. The OnTheGo database will be steadily updated on schedule.
